Console will ask if you are happy with the default personality (Happy)

If you select "no", you can put any personality type you want in.
The chatbot will start up with the chosen personality.
The chatbot will also retain memory throughout the conversation.

This was a test excersise to see if I can apply re-requisites before starting the chatbot (as well as making sure the chatbot retains memory within a while loop)
