Many of my projects through courses have not been added as they are simple 2-3 hour long projecs more centered around mastering the fundementals of Python OR a guided example.
If you would like to view them, please do not hesitate to contact me directly and I can showcase them.
I have also added proof of conecpt ideas for existing private software.

Most of the projects on this repository are more notable projects created, independant projects OR projects with little to no guidance
