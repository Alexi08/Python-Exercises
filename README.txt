Many of my projects through courses have not been added as they are simple 2-3 hour long projecs more centered around mastering the fundementals of Python OR a guided example.
I have also added proof of conecpt ideas for existing private software.

Most of the projects on this repository are more notable projects created, independant projects OR proof of concept for existing software
