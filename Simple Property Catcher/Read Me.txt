Simple program created to assist me and my partner in looking for new properties that come up within a specific area.
 The purpose was to run this daily to be notified of any new properties.

The program works by sending an email of all scraped property listings containing:
	- The name
	- Price
	- Link to address

Afterwards, it will cache all previously emailed results, meaning it will not resend the same properties twice.
